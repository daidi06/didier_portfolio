Welcome to my Portfolio.

My passion is using numbers and data to solve real-world problems and giving relevant recommendations.

From data analysis to providing recommendations, I excel at spearheading a full range of tasks related to data cleaning, data visualisation, data modelling and prediction while ensuring strict confidentiality and regulatory compliance.

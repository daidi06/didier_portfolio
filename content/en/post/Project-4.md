title: "Automatically tags questions on stackoverflow"
---

We will implement an unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised learning approach to build our tags prediction application for questions posted on stackoverflow website. We are going through data cleaning, features engineering, unsupervised learning modeling, supervised modeling and semi-supervised modeling. We are also building a client API using flask that could be found [here](https://stackoverflow-tags-prediction.herokuapp.com/). Stack Overflow offers a data export tool [here](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) that we are using to get data for building the application. This project could be found on [Github](https://github.com/daidi06/project4)

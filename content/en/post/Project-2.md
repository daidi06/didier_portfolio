We are implementing linear models, non linear models and ensemble learning to reach the best model for our machine learning application. We are going through data cleaning, features engineering and data modeling. The dataset used for this application comes from [City of seattle building energy benchmarking](https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/sea-building-energy-benchmarking#2015-building-energy-benchmarking.csv). This project could be found on [Github](https://github.com/daidi06/project2)

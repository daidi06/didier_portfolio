We are using `unsupervised Learning` to cluster customers of an e-commerce company. We are going through data cleaning, features engineering and data segmentation. We are using KMean, Minibatchkmeans, Agglomerative clustering, Spectral clustering and Density-based Clustering (DBSCAN) to reach the best clustering model. The dataset used for this application comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

We are applying one of a machine learning technique called `unsupervised Learning` to cluster foods based on their nutritional information. The dataset used for this application comes from [Open Food Fact](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). We are going through data cleaning, features engineering, dimensional reduction and data segmentation. This project could be found on [Github](https://github.com/daidi06/project1)

In this project, we will participate in a competition on Kaggle.
We will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset used for this application comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). We are comparing 9 machine learning algorithmes to reach the best prediction model.
